Interactive session with Log9: Day Zero event live streaming at APJ-103,Corporate Interaction Group <cig@iitr.ac.in>,"Greetings from Corporate Interactions Group!

Dear students, As you know, Log9 has nucleated at our campus with its
incubation at *TIDES*.

We are very proud of Log9's great success, which has emerged as the first
Indian company having competencies across materials, electrode, cell, and
pack-level fabrication of energy storage technologies.
The Log9 has commercialized its fast-charging battery technology (RapidX)
for commercial intracity EVs and LFP battery technology for long-range
vehicles. On the deployment front, Log 9 has deployed more than 3000
batteries across the e2-Wheeler and e3-Wheeler platforms. In addition to
this, Log9 has also developed high-power battery packs (ZappUp) for
stationary applications, Aluminium Air Batteries for long-haul vehicles,
and graphene-based supercapacitors. The company has filed over 60 global
patents across various materials and energy storage technologies. Till
date, Log9 has raised more than 500 Cr (INR) from various investors and has
become a team of more than 300 people.

On 21st April 2023(Tomorrow), Log9 is celebrating its foundation day (*Day
Zero*) with the inauguration of *India=E2=80=99s 1st **commercial 50MWh **e=
nd-to-end
cell manufacturing facility*. This event includes keynote speeches from
industry leaders, presentations by Log9 Materials' leadership team, a
product showcase, and interactive sessions.

On this day, Log9 is also launching an initiative called RISE (*Research
Innovation and Skill Enhancement*) through which eligible students pursuing
their graduation, post-graduation and doctorate studies can get their
projects and theses funded by Log9.

We are arranging live streaming of this event at *APJ L2-103 on 21st April
(10 AM to 12:30 PM)* and the representatives from Log9 will also be present
at the venue to provide additional information and also to answer any
questions.
We hope this event is an opportunity to learn about the latest trends and
developments in the field of cell and battery technologies and understand
how we can benefit from the RISE program.

*Goodies and Refreshments will be there!*

"Expert Talk ""Modelling fluid flow through porous media using
 MATLAB"" on April 15, 2023 during 11:00-1:00 PM at DOH",Head Hydrology <head@hy.iitr.ac.in>,"Dear All, 

The Department of Hydrology is conducting an Expert Talk "" Modelling fluid flow through porous media using MATLAB "" of two hours on Saturday (April 15, 2023) during 11:00-1:00 PM in its Conference Hall. Find below information related to this talk. 

ABSTRACT : Subsurface flow modelling for various applications like contaminant transport, nuclear waste disposal, geothermal flows, carbon capture sequestration, and hydrocarbon flows involves uses of traditional numerical simulation tools. MATLAB is one tool, which allows for modelling various aspects of fluid flow through porous media. More recently, MATLAB is also used for modelling data driven models for subsurface flows. It has been used for deep learning methods as well as traditional numerical simulation to achieve fast and accurate modelling of subsurface flow and solute transport problems. 

Speaker : Prof. Mayur Pal, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Kaunas University of Technology 


SPEAKER BIO : Prof. Mayur Pal received Ph.D. degree in Computational Engineering from Swansea University, Wales, UK in 2007. After finishing his Ph.D. Mayur Pal worked at Shell International Exploration and Production B.V. Research Centre in Rijswijk, followed by Maersk Oil Research and Technology Centre. He also held positions as head of enhanced oil recovery team and head of asset in North Oil Company, Qatar. He is currently Prof. at Department of Mathematical Modelling at KTU, Kaunas, Lithuania. His research interest includes, subsurface flows, multiscale, modelling, discrete fracture network modelling, enhanced oil recovery, CCUS, Hydrogen storage, data science and machine learning applications to solve problems in engineering and sciences.
